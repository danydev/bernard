Framework Integration
=====================

To make it easier to get started and have it "just work" with sending messages,
a number of integrations have been created.

Symfony
-------

The `bernard/bernard-bundle <https://github.com/bernardphp/BernardBundle>`_ integrates Bernard with a Symfony application.

Silex
-----

There is a `bernard/silex <https://github.com/bernardphp/silex>`_ package which enables usage
of Bernard in your Silex applications.

Laravel
-------

The officially supported Laravel package can be found at `bernard/laravel <https://github.com/bernardphp/laravel>`_.
